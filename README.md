# Drive Free – Android App

Drive Free is an Android app inspired by a powerful story of a survivor whose life was changed by a distracted driving accident caused by someone using their mobile phone behind the wheel.

The goal of this app is to help reduce distractions while driving by automatically managing your phone’s sound settings.

How It Works
	•	Uses Android’s context-aware capabilities to detect when the user is driving.
	•	Automatically switches the phone to silent mode while driving.
	•	Restores the phone to its original sound setting once driving has ended.
